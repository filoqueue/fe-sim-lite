# fe-sim-lite
This project is meant to simulate the Arena found in Fire Emblems 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, etc where upon choosing a unit, that unit fights enemy units until it can do so no longer.  Most calculations are taken from FE9 but some things are taken from other titles like the double weapon triangle from FE14 and some classes and units from all games.
